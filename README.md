# 📌 Reddit Text Insights

**Reddit Text Insights** is a project for dynamic text analysis of Reddit posts using **NLP, LangChain, and Hugging Face**. The system collects data, processes it, and provides valuable insights into content through advanced text analysis and machine learning techniques.

## 🚀 Key Technologies
- **Python** – Primary programming language
- **Reddit API** – For dynamic data collection
- **Pandas & NumPy** – For data manipulation and processing
- **LangChain** – For managing intelligent pipelines
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – For applying advanced models
- **FastAPI** – For creating an interactive API interface
- **Docker** – For running the system in a controlled environment
- **GitHub Actions** – For CI/CD management
